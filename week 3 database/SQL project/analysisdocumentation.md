## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze expense data to gain insights into spending patterns across different categories and departments. By using SQL, we grouped and summarized the data to better understand where most expenses occur, the average spending in each department, and total expenses for each category.
## Analysis Goals
The analysis focused on:
- Counting entries in each expense category to identify the most frequent types of expenses.
- Summing total expenses in each category to understand overall spending distribution.
- Calculating the average amount spent per department.
- Summarizing these results to gain insights into expense trends.
## SQL Queries Used

### 1. Count Entries in Each Category
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS entry_count FROM expenses GROUP BY category;
## Key Findings and Insights

- **Most Frequent Category**: The `Food` category had the highest number of entries, indicating frequent small expenses in this area.
- **Highest Total Spending**: The `Travel` category showed the highest total spending, suggesting significant costs associated with travel activities.
- **Department Averages**: The `Sales` department had a higher average expense than others, possibly due to frequent travel and client meetings.
## Conclusion and Next Steps
The analysis provided a clearer view of expense patterns, revealing high costs in travel and frequent expenses in food. Future analyses could focus on identifying outliers or seasonal spending trends, and further breaking down travel expenses to determine potential cost-saving opportunities.
